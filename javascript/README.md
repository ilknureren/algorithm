What is JavaScript ? JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

To run the algoritm in command line: 
`script index.js`
(index.js because this is the files name. If the file was a different name, this would be `script` followed by whatever the name of the folder is)

How are Javascript and Java similar, and how are they different?
