The command line is a text interface for your computer. It's a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computer's operating system to run. From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac OS.

Command Line

CD: Change Directory
`cd ../` :Moves down one directory
`cd (file_name)`:Moves up one directory

LS: List
`ls`
`ls` lists all files and directories in the working directory.
