What is JavaScript ? JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

To run the algoritm in command line: 
`script index.js`
(index.js because this is the files name. If the file was a different name, this would be `script` followed by whatever the name of the folder is)

How are Javascript and Java similar, and how are they different? One of the major differences between the two is that Javascript code only runs inside a web browser, while Java can be used to develop desktop and mobile applications as well as web applications.
